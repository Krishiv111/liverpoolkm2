# Panel Speakers 
- Colin; Mechanical Engineer 3rd Year @ ucsd
- Tristian: Miramar college CS, Tristians Koolaid
- Maebelle; USCD cognitive science, cs adjacentt major 
- Anthony; Computer science @ UCI, and viasap internship 

# Takeaways 
- This panel was able to help me get an overall better understanding of what it takes to get a profession and a degree in a computer science or engineering field. One of the biggest take away I got from the panel was how important fundamentals are in a computer science class, this is becuase without these specific skills it will be harder to grasp greater concepts and understand. In addition if you want to go on are create bigger and better projects it takes a greater understanding of these basics. 

- In addition I learned about how to advance yourself or become " more than just a brick in the wall" as anthony said, through the use of personal projects, as talked by the panel speakers personal projects is a way to apply your understadning of a coding topic or subject. Although it may be hard to get started you should look for things that you are passionate about even if it may be simple beucase these projects will help you deepen your understadnign on a topic. Also it's important to get started with small projects in your freetime as you can use them as a project on a resume for a job opportunity. 

# Reflection
-  This panel is a really great wa yto give me a better understanding of a daily life in computer science and other related majors. I also learned a lot about diffrent expectations. This will help me for the rest of the year as it emphasis the importance of the basics which i will strive to understadn in tri 1, with the use of jupyter notebooks and in class lectures. Also it taught me the importance of the balance of technicallity within learning aspects like leet code with data structures and algorithms combined with personal projects and creativity allowing me  to become a more balanced programmer for the future.
