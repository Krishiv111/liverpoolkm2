# What I worked on this week
- This week in order to have a significant commit I worked on planning of the bakcend as well as creation of the Cancer class for my group. Throughout the week I reaserached tpyes of Api's but then I shortly realized that many apis didnt have types of data that were looking for so its better to take offical data from the CDC and implement that. 
- To display this I was able to create the Cancer Array, however I am still in the process of finding accurate data which allows to have a set of data that we can create models for and alanyze within the frontend
- Also I made a Drawio about what we worked on this week and what we continue to work on.
