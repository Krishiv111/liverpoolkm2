- Good understanding of code
- Usage of constructors and methods in JAVA 

# What I could improve on 
- Having inputs and outpts rather than just a function 
- Relating of rubric
- Bettee usage of documentation 

# How I improved

- I addded a getter and setter method class within my code 
- I made sure my code  was running and working correctly
